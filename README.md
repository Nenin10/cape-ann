# LIBRARY
Books Database - Library Web Application

Specification
-------------
As we noted during interview here are some key notes for project you should work on to improve your skills.

Technologies to use:
- HTML
- Javascript/jQuery
- CSS
- Bootstrap
- PHP
- MySQL

Short overview for front-end and back-end is noted below:
##### Front-End
 - Bootstrap (responsive site)
 - Some animations
##### Back-End
 - MySQL database schema and queries
 - Forms (client and server side validation/sanitize)
 - Clean code and if possible using class and methods (Object oriented programming is preferable)

Example project structure:

We would love to see some kind of system where we would have admins and regular users. Both roles have ability to log in to system, see their profile informations, edit their profile informations.
In addition admin have access to add/edit/block/delete users.
System should have some purpose, e.g. library, shop, inventory etc.
For example of library, admin have ways to add/edit/delete book entry, regular users have ability to search books. If you decide to have something else than library then similar thing should be implemented.

As said in person, having system just functional with bunch of hard-code stuff or messy code would bring no good. Having nice clean site, with good code structure, object-oriented , with good database scheme would be preferable.

When completed please push your code to git and share git repository with us. (It would be good for you to push commits to git occasionally, not just to push code when everything is completed)

If you have any questions please let us know and happy coding.
